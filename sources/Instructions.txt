   start-all.cmd

2. Then start Derby, go to dir where derby is installed, and execute:

   startNetworkServer -h 0.0.0.0

3. Then start Hive, go to the directory where hive is installed, and execute:

   hive

4. When you see the 'hive>' prompt, enter the following command to create a table:

   CREATE TABLE items (Description string, Url string, price double) row format delimited fields terminated by ',';

5. After creating the table, enter the following command to load the CSV file that we have already scraped in Milestone 1:

   LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'input.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE items;

6. To verify the import into Hadoop, run the following command select and display the loaded data:

   SELECT * FROM items;

7. You should see an output showing the data as from the CSV.
